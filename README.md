# Messaging-App
My messaging app for 13 Computer Science 2016

The server must be running in order to open the client.
The server uses port 3600
Nothing is encrypted and everything is stored in plaintext so don't use a username/password that you use for other things.
Some test accounts (case sensitive):
    "username: user; password: 123"
    "username: Server; password: password"
I haven't tried many different resolutions so it might look weird on your monitor.
